     <li>Add the butter, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 300 g of the mixed cheeses, and beat well until homogenized.</li>
     <li>Stuff the bread with the filling and transfer the loaf to a baking pan lined with parchment paper, cut-side facing down.</li>
     <li>Spread 1 tablespoon olive oil, 50 g of the cheese, and bake the bread for 10 minutes.</li>
     <li>Place a frying pan over high heat.</li>
     <li>Cut the garlic bread into slices and add them to the pan until golden.</li>
     <li>Remove and serve.</li>
